If you have any improvements, ideas or find any bugs, don't hesitate to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## 🛑 Important Note

1. **Do not push your Nodemailer pass on Github** as it can give access to your google email. Use `.env` file
2. Use [Nextjs api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) for nodemailer transporters and send mail function as they only run on server and cannot expose your google app variables to client
3. Update google site verification code with your own inside `/src/data/siteMetaData.mjs`. Can be created for free using your google email id at <https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome>
